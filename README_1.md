Project Title: AtomProcure Assistant
Project Description
AtomProcure Assistant is an intelligent prototype service, combining chat-bot functionality and a user-friendly web interface, powered by cutting-edge AI technologies. The service leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative neural networks to classify user queries and generate highly relevant responses based on the regulatory documentation within the procurement sphere of Rosatom.

Features
NLP-Powered Classification: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to accurately classify user queries related to Rosatom's procurement processes.

Generative Neural Networks: Employs generative neural networks to generate contextually relevant responses by extracting information from the extensive pool of regulatory documents.

Web Interface: Offers an intuitive web interface for users to interact seamlessly with the service, making the process of obtaining information more user-friendly.

Real-time Assistance: Provides real-time responses, optimizing the user experience and reducing the time spent searching for pertinent information.
